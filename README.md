# AI_Python_GoogleAIGemini_Course-Alura

## Description

This project showcases the development of a chatbox and the application of AI agents using Google Gemini models with Python, created as part of an Alura course.

## Project Overview

The course focused on building practical applications using Google Gemini and Python. Two main projects were developed:

### 1. Chatbox for General Research

* A chatbox application that allows users to conduct research on any topic.
* The chat session can be terminated by entering the command `"fim"`.

### 2. Social Media Post Creation with AI Agents

* An application employing four AI agents to automate the creation of a social media post:

    * **Agent 1: Information Retrieval**
        * This agent searches for relevant information from the past month.
    * **Agent 2: Content Analysis**
        * This agent analyzes the retrieved information and identifies the most relevant points with the highest potential for user engagement.
    * **Agent 3: Post Generation**
        * This agent generates a social media post for a user-specified platform.
    * **Agent 4: Post Refinement**
        * This agent revises the generated post, correcting any spelling errors and adjusting the tone for optimal posting.
